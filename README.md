# WebRTC PeerJS Chat

A minimal peer-to-peer text chat application that enables direct browser-to-browser communication using WebRTC technology. The application allows two users to connect using unique peer IDs and exchange messages in real-time without requiring a central server for message relay.

## Live Deployment

ðŸš€ **Access the live application**: [https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html](https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html)

## Features

- **Direct P2P Communication**: Messages flow directly between browsers after connection establishment
- **No Server Dependencies**: Uses PeerJS cloud signaling and Google STUN servers for connection setup
- **Modular ESM Architecture**: Native ES modules with separate CSS; no build step required
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message delivery between connected peers
- **File Transfer**: Send and receive files with progress indicators and downloads list
- **Audio/Video Calling**: Start a 1:1 call with microphone and camera
- **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen during a call and stop sharing anytime
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, minimal UI focused on core chat, file transfers, and calls

## How to Test

### Multi-Network Testing

1. **Open the application** on two different devices/networks:
   - Device 1: Open [https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html](https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html)
   - Device 2: Open [https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html](https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html)

2. **Wait for Peer IDs**:
   - Each page automatically shows its unique peer ID under "Your Peer ID"

3. **Establish Connection**:
   - On Device 1: Enter Device 2's peer ID and click "Connect"
   - On Device 2: Enter Device 1's peer ID and click "Connect"
   - Wait for the connection status to show "Connected"

4. **Start Chatting**:
   - Type messages in the message input field
   - Click "Send" or press Enter
   - Messages will appear in real-time on both devices

5. **File Transfer (optional)**:
   - Choose a small file via the file picker
   - Click "Send File" and watch the send/receive progress
   - The peer will see a download link under "Downloads"

### Testing Scenarios

- **Same Network**: Test between devices on the same WiFi network
- **Different Networks**: Test between devices on different ISPs/networks
- **Mobile/Desktop**: Test between mobile devices and desktop computers
- **Different Browsers**: Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers

## Technical Requirements

## Development

### Development Environment Setup

This application uses cutting-edge JavaScript features (ES2020+) and requires proper IDE configuration for optimal development experience.

#### Quick Setup

1. **Modern Browser**: Use Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, or Safari 14+
2. **IDE Configuration**: Configure your IDE for ES2020+ JavaScript support
3. **HTTPS Server**: Use HTTPS for local development (WebRTC requirement)

#### Detailed IDE Configuration

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mehrmorgen/CanChat.git
cd CanChat

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start HTTPS dev server (required for WebRTC)
bun run dev

# Open the app (accept self-signed cert warning)
open https://localhost:8443/chat.html
# or manually visit the URL in your browser
```

Note: If HTTPS certificate files are missing, generate selfâ€‘signed certs (development only):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -days 30 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

#### Development Features

When running locally, the application provides additional development features:

- **Environment Indicator**: Shows development mode status in top-right corner
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging
- **Compatibility Checks**: Automatic validation of modern JavaScript features
- **IDE Detection**: Identifies your development environment and provides guidance

#### Modern JavaScript Features Used

This application leverages cutting-edge JavaScript features:

- **Optional Chaining** (`?.`): Safe property access
- **Nullish Coalescing** (`??`): Default value assignment
- **BigInt**: Large integer support
- **Private Class Fields** (`#private`): True encapsulation
- **Promise.allSettled**: Advanced promise handling
- **Modern Array Methods**: `flatMap`, `structuredClone`
- **Top-level Await**: Module-level async operations

#### Browser Requirements for Development

- **Chrome 88+** (January 2021) - Recommended for development
- **Firefox 85+** (January 2021) - Full feature support
- **Safari 14+** (September 2020) - WebKit compatibility
- **Edge 88+** (January 2021) - Chromium-based support

#### Troubleshooting Development Issues

**Syntax Errors in IDE**:
- Update JavaScript language version to ES2020+
- Install modern JavaScript extensions
- Configure parser settings for latest features

**WebRTC Not Working Locally**:
- Use HTTPS (required for WebRTC)
- Run `bun run dev` for local HTTPS
- Avoid `file://` protocol for testing

**Modern Features Not Recognized**:
- Check browser version (must be modern)
- Verify IDE configuration for ES2020+
- Configure your IDE for modern JavaScript features

For more detailed troubleshooting, the application's environment detection system will automatically identify issues and provide specific guidance.

### Deployment Process

This application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Any push to the `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
2. **No Build Process**: The `chat.html` file is served directly as a static file
3. **HTTPS Enforcement**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS
4. **Global CDN**: GitHub's CDN ensures fast loading worldwide

#### GitHub Pages Configuration

- **Repository**: `mehrmorgen/CanChat`
- **Source Branch**: `main` (root directory)
- **Deployment URL**: [https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html](https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html)
- **HTTPS Enforced**: Yes (automatic)
- **Custom Domain**: Not configured (using github.io subdomain)

#### URL Sharing Instructions

To share the application for testing:

1. **Direct Link**: Share `https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html`
2. **QR Code**: Generate QR code for the URL for mobile device testing
3. **Testing Setup**:
   - Open the URL on both devices (peer IDs appear automatically under "Your Peer ID")
   - Exchange peer IDs and click "Connect" on each device
   - Send messages both ways to verify real-time chat
   - Optionally send a small file to verify file transfer

#### Deployment Verification

- âœ… GitHub Pages enabled on `main` branch
- âœ… `chat.html` accessible at deployment URL
- âœ… HTTPS enforcement active
- âœ… Automatic deployment on push verified
- âœ… WebRTC functionality working over HTTPS

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to connect to peer"
- **Solution**: Ensure both devices are using HTTPS (GitHub Pages URL)
- **Check**: Verify peer IDs are entered correctly
- **Network**: Some corporate firewalls may block WebRTC

**Problem**: WebRTC not working
- **Solution**: Use the GitHub Pages HTTPS URL, not local file:// protocol
- **Browser**: Ensure you're using a modern browser with WebRTC support

**Problem**: Can't generate peer ID
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors
- **Network**: Ensure PeerJS cloud server is accessible

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow connection establishment
- **Cause**: NAT traversal may take time on some networks
- **Solution**: Wait up to 30 seconds for connection establishment

**Problem**: Messages not appearing
- **Check**: Verify connection status shows "Connected!"
- **Retry**: Try refreshing both pages and reconnecting

## Testing

Run unit tests with Bun:

```bash
bun test
bun test --watch
bun test --coverage
```

Note: Optional browser automation examples using Playwright are available (see `tests/automation`). These require the HTTPS dev server to be running and are not part of the default test script.
