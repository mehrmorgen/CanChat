# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing the most modern JavaScript features and APIs available in current versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. The WebRTC PeerJS Chat application will leverage cutting-edge browser capabilities to provide the best possible user experience, with no consideration for backwards compatibility or legacy browser support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest JavaScript features available in modern browsers, so that I can build the most efficient and maintainable application possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1

1. WHEN I implement new features THEN the system SHALL use the most recent JavaScript syntax and APIs available in current browser versions
2. WHEN I write code THEN the system SHALL leverage modern features like optional chaining, nullish coalescing, top-level await, and private class fields
3. WHEN I need new functionality THEN the system SHALL prioritize native browser APIs over polyfills or libraries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to utilize cutting-edge WebRTC and browser APIs, so that I can provide the best real-time communication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN I implement WebRTC features THEN the system SHALL use the latest WebRTC APIs and specifications
2. WHEN I handle media streams THEN the system SHALL leverage modern MediaStream and MediaDevices APIs
3. WHEN I manage peer connections THEN the system SHALL use current RTCPeerConnection features and event handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement modern asynchronous patterns and error handling, so that I can create robust and performant code.

#### Acceptance Criteria 3

1. WHEN I handle asynchronous operations THEN the system SHALL use async/await with modern Promise features
2. WHEN I manage errors THEN the system SHALL leverage AggregateError and modern error handling patterns
3. WHEN I work with data THEN the system SHALL use modern array and object methods like flatMap, Object.fromEntries, and structuredClone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use modern DOM and Web APIs, so that I can create a responsive and interactive user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN I manipulate the DOM THEN the system SHALL use modern methods like replaceChildren, toggleAttribute, and closest
2. WHEN I handle events THEN the system SHALL leverage modern event handling with AbortController and passive listeners
3. WHEN I work with storage THEN the system SHALL use modern storage APIs like IndexedDB with async/await patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement modern testing patterns and development tools, so that I can ensure code quality and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN I write tests THEN the system SHALL use modern testing patterns with native browser testing capabilities
2. WHEN I validate code THEN the system SHALL leverage modern JavaScript features for assertions and mocking
3. WHEN I debug applications THEN the system SHALL use current browser developer tools and debugging APIs
