# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses JavaScript syntax compatibility issues that may arise during development or deployment of the WebRTC PeerJS Chat application. The application intentionally uses ES2020+ features like optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) as part of its modern browser detection and legacy browser blocking system. This spec provides solutions for development environment compatibility while maintaining the production behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand why optional chaining syntax causes errors in my development environment, so that I can configure my tools properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1

1. WHEN I encounter "',' expected" errors with optional chaining THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation explaining this is intentional behavior
2. WHEN I review the code THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that ES2020+ syntax is used for modern browser detection
3. WHEN I need to develop locally THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for development environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure my development environment to support ES2020+ syntax, so that I can work with the modern JavaScript features used in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN I configure my IDE THEN it SHALL support ES2020+ syntax including optional chaining and nullish coalescing
2. WHEN I configure my browser for testing THEN it SHALL support all ES2020+ features used in the application
3. WHEN I configure my linting tools THEN they SHALL recognize ES2020+ syntax as valid

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want alternative approaches for handling syntax compatibility during development, so that I can work effectively while maintaining production behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria 3

1. WHEN I need development compatibility THEN the system SHALL provide conditional compilation options
2. WHEN I need to test legacy browser blocking THEN the system SHALL provide testing utilities
3. WHEN I need to validate syntax THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the modern browser detection system works correctly, so that legacy browsers are properly blocked while modern browsers function normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN a modern browser accesses the application THEN it SHALL parse and execute all ES2020+ syntax correctly
2. WHEN a legacy browser accesses the application THEN it SHALL encounter syntax errors and display the browser upgrade warning
3. WHEN testing browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which features are supported

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for JavaScript syntax compatibility, so that I can ensure the application works correctly across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL validate ES2020+ feature support
2. WHEN testing browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL verify modern browser detection works correctly
3. WHEN testing legacy browser blocking THEN the system SHALL confirm syntax errors trigger appropriate warnings
