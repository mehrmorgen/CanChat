# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing WebRTC POC chat application from its current single-file architecture to a Bun-based development environment with proper module structure. The migration will maintain the core peer-to-peer chat functionality while introducing modern development tooling, ESM module structure, and improved developer experience through Bun's fast runtime and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clone the repo and run a development server using Bun, so that I can work with modern JavaScript tooling and fast development cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer clones the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a `bunfig.toml` configuration file with `dev`, `test`, and `start` scripts compatible with Bun v1.x
2. WHEN a developer runs `bun run dev` THEN the system SHALL start a development server in less than 100ms
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the application on a configurable port (default 3000)
4. IF Bun supports HMR (Hot Module Replacement) THEN the system SHALL apply HMR, OTHERWISE the system SHALL provide fast reload functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all source code organized in ESM modules, so that I can benefit from modern JavaScript import/export syntax and better code organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all source files in `src/` SHALL use native ESM syntax with `import` and `export` statements
2. WHEN modules are imported THEN the system SHALL NOT use CommonJS `require()` or `module.exports` syntax
3. WHEN `chat.html` loads THEN the system SHALL use `<script type="module" src="/src/chat.js">` instead of inline scripts
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL work correctly under `bun run dev` with the new module structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run unit tests using Bun's native test runner, so that I can validate functionality with fast test execution and watch mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `bun test` THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests in the `tests/` directory
2. WHEN a developer runs `bun test --watch` THEN the system SHALL automatically re-run tests when source files change
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL NOT require additional flags or configuration beyond the base `bun test` command
4. WHEN test files are written THEN the system SHALL use ESM import syntax to import modules under test

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the WebRTC chat functionality to remain fully functional after migration, so that the core application features are preserved during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two browser contexts are opened THEN users SHALL be able to exchange peer IDs as before
2. WHEN a peer connection is established THEN the DataChannel chat functionality SHALL work identically to the original implementation
3. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL deliver them in real-time between connected peers
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all WebRTC and PeerJS functionality SHALL operate without regression

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure with separated concerns, so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL organize code into `src/chat.js` as the main entrypoint and `src/utils.js` for helper functions
2. WHEN the HTML file loads THEN the system SHALL NOT contain inline JavaScript code
3. WHEN modules are structured THEN each file SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use `bun install` for any required packages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage maintained during migration, so that code quality and reliability are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are migrated THEN the system SHALL convert all existing test assertions to work with Bun's test runner
2. WHEN test files are updated THEN the system SHALL change `require` statements to `import` statements
3. WHEN `tests/utils.test.js` runs THEN the system SHALL execute successfully under `bun test`
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% code coverage as per the original TDD approach
