# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update steering documentation for Bun development environment
  - Update `.kiro/steering/tech.md` with Bun-specific commands and development methodology
  - Update `.kiro/steering/structure.md` with new modular project structure
  - Update `.kiro/steering/product.md` to reflect ESM development approach
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Create Bun configuration files
  - Create `bunfig.toml` with development, test, and start script configurations
  - Create `package.json` with ESM type declaration and script definitions
  - Configure Bun registry settings and test runner options
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Extract and modularize CSS styles
  - Create `src/styles.css` by extracting all inline CSS from `chat.html`
  - Maintain all existing responsive design and CSS custom properties
  - Preserve all animations, transitions, and mobile-first approach
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Create utility functions module with ESM exports
  - Create `src/utils.js` with ESM export syntax for utility functions
  - Extract timestamp formatting, peer ID validation, and message creation functions
  - Export test framework setup and DOM helper functions
  - Write unit tests in `tests/utils.test.js` using Bun test runner and ESM imports
  - After the task is complete, commit all changes to the repository
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 5. Create main application module with ESM structure
  - Create `src/chat.js` as main application entrypoint using ESM imports
  - Import utility functions from `./utils.js` using native ESM syntax
  - Maintain all existing WebRTC and PeerJS functionality
  - Remove any Node.js-specific code and ensure browser compatibility
  - After the task is complete, commit all changes to the repository
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Update HTML file to use modular structure
  - Remove all inline `<script>` tags from `chat.html`
  - Add `<script type="module" src="/src/chat.js">` module reference
  - Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/styles.css">` for extracted styles
  - Maintain all existing DOM structure and element IDs for compatibility
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Install and configure Bun dependencies
  - Run `bun install` to set up package management
  - Verify all external dependencies (PeerJS) work with ESM imports
  - Configure any additional development dependencies if needed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Verify development server functionality
  - Run `bun run dev` to start the development server
  - Verify server starts in less than 100ms as required
  - Test that `http://localhost:3000/chat.html` loads correctly
  - Confirm all ESM modules load and execute properly
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 9. Migrate and execute test suite
  - Convert all existing test assertions to work with Bun's test runner
  - Update test files to use `import` statements instead of `require`
  - Create `tests/chat.test.js` for integration tests using ESM imports
  - Create `tests/dom.test.js` for DOM manipulation tests
  - Run `bun test --watch` and verify all tests pass
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Perform comprehensive smoke testing
  - Open two browser contexts to test peer-to-peer functionality
  - Exchange peer IDs between browser instances
  - Send and receive messages to confirm DataChannel chat works
  - Verify all WebRTC functionality operates without regression
  - Test responsive design and mobile compatibility
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 11. Validate test coverage and quality
  - Run complete test suite with `bun test` to ensure 100% coverage
  - Verify all module boundaries and exports are properly tested
  - Confirm integration tests cover end-to-end WebRTC workflows
  - Fix any module import errors or assertion failures
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Final integration and deployment verification
  - Test the complete development workflow from clone to running application
  - Verify hot reload functionality works as expected (if supported by Bun)
  - Confirm the application maintains all original functionality
  - Document any differences in behavior or new capabilities
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.4_
