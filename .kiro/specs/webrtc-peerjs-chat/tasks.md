  - Use modern APIs like const/let, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring where appropriate
  - Remove any defensive coding for older browser quirks
  - Update error handling to use modern patterns
  - Verify functionality on recent Chrome, Firefox, and Safari versions
  - Ensure all existing tests still pass after modernization
  - Commit: "Refactor code for modern browsers only, remove legacy compatibility patterns"
