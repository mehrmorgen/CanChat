# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a minimal WebRTC peer-to-peer text chat application using PeerJS for signaling and Google STUN servers for NAT traversal. The application will be delivered as a single HTML file with no build dependencies, making it easy to run in any modern browser. The chat enables direct communication between two peers using their browser-generated peer IDs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my unique peer ID when the page loads, so that I can share it with another person to establish a chat connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL instantiate a new Peer() with default PeerJS cloud server and STUN server stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
2. WHEN the peer connection is ready THEN the system SHALL display the auto-assigned peer ID in an element with id "my-id"
3. WHEN the peer ID is ready THEN the system SHALL show "System: Your ID is ready; share it with your peer." in the chat log

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to another peer using their ID, so that we can start chatting directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide an input field with id "peer-id-input" for entering another peer's ID
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a "Connect" button to initiate connection to the entered peer ID
3. WHEN I click the Connect button with a valid peer ID THEN the system SHALL attempt to establish a connection to that peer
4. WHEN a connection is successfully established (outgoing or incoming) THEN the system SHALL display "System: âš¡ Connection established" in the chat log
5. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL enable the message sending functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send and receive text messages in real-time, so that I can have a conversation with the connected peer.

#### Acceptance Criteria 3

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a textarea with id "chat-log" to display message history
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a message input field and "Send" button for composing messages
3. WHEN no connection is established THEN the system SHALL keep the Send button disabled
4. WHEN a connection is established THEN the system SHALL enable the Send button
5. WHEN I send a message THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat log prefixed with "Me: "
6. WHEN I receive a message from the peer THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat log prefixed with "Peer: "
7. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL display them in the chat log prefixed with "System: "

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when the connection is closed, so that I know the chat session has ended.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN the connection is closed (by either peer) THEN the system SHALL display "System: Connection closed" in the chat log
2. WHEN the connection is closed THEN the system SHALL disable the Send button
3. WHEN the connection is closed THEN the system SHALL allow establishing a new connection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be self-contained with no build dependencies, so that it can be easily deployed and run anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL be contained in a single HTML file named "chat.html"
2. WHEN the application is created THEN all JavaScript logic SHALL be contained within a single script tag
3. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL not require any external build tools or bundlers
4. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL include minimal inline CSS for basic readability
5. WHEN the application is created THEN the JavaScript code SHALL be organized with comments dividing setup, event handlers, and helper functions
6. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL include Jest testing framework via CDN for unit testing
7. WHEN the application is created THEN it SHALL follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be clean and functional, so that I can focus on the chat functionality without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria 6

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a minimal, readable interface
2. WHEN the page loads THEN all UI elements SHALL be properly labeled and accessible
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the layout SHALL be responsive and work on different screen sizes
4. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN visual feedback SHALL be provided for user actions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all functionality, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria 7

1. WHEN developing the application THEN all functionality SHALL be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
2. WHEN the application is complete THEN it SHALL have 100% unit test coverage for all JavaScript functions
3. WHEN the application is complete THEN it SHALL include integration tests for complete user workflows
4. WHEN the application is complete THEN it SHALL include tests for error handling and edge cases
5. WHEN the application is complete THEN all tests SHALL be executable within the browser environment
6. WHEN each feature is implemented THEN changes SHALL be committed to version control with descriptive commit messages
