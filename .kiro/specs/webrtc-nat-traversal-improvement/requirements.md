# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses WebRTC connection reliability issues when peers are on different network types (mobile cellular vs WiFi, different ISPs, behind different NAT configurations). Currently, the chat application works well for peers on the same local network but struggles with cross-network connections due to NAT traversal limitations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile cellular network, I want to connect to a peer on WiFi, so that I can chat regardless of our network types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user attempts to connect to a WiFi user THEN the system SHALL establish a successful WebRTC connection within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the initial connection attempt fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with different ICE server configurations
3. WHEN connection establishment takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators to the user
4. IF direct peer-to-peer connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt TURN relay as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user behind a restrictive NAT/firewall, I want reliable connection establishment, so that I can use the chat application from corporate or public networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting from behind symmetric NAT THEN the system SHALL use TURN servers for relay connection
2. WHEN STUN servers fail to determine public IP THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative STUN servers
3. WHEN ICE gathering takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to the user
4. IF connection fails after all attempts THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive connection diagnostics, so that I can troubleshoot WebRTC connection issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection establishment begins THEN the system SHALL log all ICE candidates and their types
2. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reasons and network diagnostics
3. WHEN testing connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate STUN/TURN server accessibility
4. IF connection quality degrades THEN the system SHALL monitor and report connection statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic connection optimization, so that I get the best possible connection quality without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connection THEN the system SHALL automatically select optimal ICE servers based on network conditions
2. WHEN multiple connection paths are available THEN the system SHALL choose the path with lowest latency
3. WHEN connection quality changes THEN the system SHALL adapt ICE server selection dynamically
4. IF connection becomes unstable THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-establish using different servers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fallback connection methods, so that I can still communicate even when direct P2P fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN direct P2P connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt connection through TURN relay servers
2. WHEN free TURN servers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide information about premium TURN services
3. WHEN all connection methods fail THEN the system SHALL offer alternative communication suggestions
4. IF relay connection is established THEN the system SHALL inform the user about potential latency implications
