# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements GitHub Pages deployment for the WebRTC PeerJS Chat application to enable testing across different networks and devices. The deployment will make the chat application accessible via a public HTTPS URL, which is required for WebRTC functionality in production environments. This allows users to test peer-to-peer connections between different networks, devices, and browsers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the chat application to GitHub Pages, so that it can be accessed via HTTPS from any network for testing WebRTC functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is configured THEN it SHALL have GitHub Pages enabled with source set to deploy from the main branch
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via the GitHub Pages URL (https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html)
3. WHEN the application is accessed via HTTPS THEN WebRTC functionality SHALL work correctly across different networks
4. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain all existing functionality from local testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test the chat application between different networks, so that I can verify peer-to-peer connectivity works in real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application from different networks THEN both peers SHALL be able to generate unique peer IDs
2. WHEN connecting from different networks THEN peers SHALL successfully establish WebRTC connections through NAT traversal
3. WHEN connected across networks THEN message exchange SHALL work in real-time without latency issues
4. WHEN testing across networks THEN connection stability SHALL be maintained throughout the chat session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment process to be automated and reliable, so that updates to the application are automatically published.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Pages SHALL automatically rebuild and deploy the updated application
2. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the process SHALL complete without manual intervention
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN GitHub SHALL provide clear error messages and logs
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the updated application SHALL be immediately accessible via https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deployed application to handle HTTPS requirements properly, so that WebRTC features work correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads over HTTPS THEN all WebRTC APIs SHALL be available and functional
2. WHEN establishing peer connections THEN STUN server communication SHALL work correctly over HTTPS
3. WHEN using PeerJS signaling THEN the connection to PeerJS cloud servers SHALL be secure and reliable
4. WHEN testing on modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 88+) THEN WebRTC functionality SHALL work correctly over cellular and WiFi networks without polyfills

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the deployed application maintains performance and reliability, so that it provides a good testing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN page load time SHALL be under 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
2. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the application SHALL handle concurrent usage without degradation
3. WHEN testing over extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks
4. WHEN accessing from modern browsers THEN native ES2020+ features SHALL work without transpilation across Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, and Safari 14+

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for network-specific issues, so that users get helpful feedback when testing across different networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the application SHALL display appropriate connection status messages
2. WHEN NAT traversal fails THEN the application SHALL provide helpful error messages about firewall/network restrictions
3. WHEN PeerJS signaling fails THEN the application SHALL indicate server connectivity issues clearly
4. WHEN connection drops during chat THEN the application SHALL handle reconnection gracefully with user feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily share the application URL for testing, so that I can quickly set up multi-network testing sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the GitHub Pages URL SHALL be easily shareable and memorable
2. WHEN sharing the URL THEN it SHALL work correctly without additional configuration or parameters
3. WHEN accessing the shared URL THEN users SHALL immediately see the functional chat interface
4. WHEN multiple people access the URL THEN each SHALL get unique peer IDs for testing connections
