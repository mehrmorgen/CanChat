- [x] 3. Configure GitHub repository for Pages deployment
  - Verify GitHub repository settings have Pages enabled with source set to main branch
  - Ensure chat.html file is in the correct location for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Create or update repository README.md with deployment URL and testing instructions
  - Configure repository settings to enforce HTTPS for the GitHub Pages site
  - Test that the deployment URL <https://mehrmorgen.github.io/CanChat/chat.html> is accessible
  - Verify automatic deployment triggers when code is pushed to main branch
  - Document the deployment process and URL sharing instructions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 7.1, 7.2_

- [x] 4. Implement network-specific error handling and user feedback
  - Add connection status indicators to show network connectivity state
  - Implement specific error messages for NAT traversal failures
  - Create user-friendly error messages for firewall/network restriction scenarios
  - Add timeout handling for connection attempts across different networks
  - Implement retry logic for failed connection attempts with exponential backoff
  - Add visual feedback for connection establishment progress across networks
  - Create diagnostic information display for troubleshooting network issues
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 5. Add performance monitoring and optimization for deployment
  - Implement page load time measurement and display for performance monitoring
  - Add connection establishment time tracking for network performance analysis
  - Create memory usage monitoring to detect potential leaks during extended sessions
  - Optimize resource loading order to improve initial page load performance
  - Add lazy loading for non-critical resources to improve perceived performance
  - Implement connection quality indicators for real-time network performance feedback
  - Create performance metrics logging for deployment analysis
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Enhance modern browser and mobile experience for deployment
  - Add strict modern browser version detection and hard blocking for legacy browsers
  - Implement mobile-first responsive design using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Custom Properties
  - Use native ES2020+ features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, async/await) without transpilation
  - Leverage Safari 14+ modern WebRTC features and native JavaScript improvements
  - Implement clear upgrade messaging with specific version requirements for browsers below minimum
  - Use latest browser APIs without polyfills for modern mobile network handling
  - Create version-specific upgrade guidance directing users to modern browser downloads
  - Commit your changes
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive deployment testing and validation suite
  - Write automated tests to verify GitHub Pages deployment accessibility
  - Create network connectivity tests that can be run from the deployed application
  - Implement multi-network testing scenarios with detailed logging
  - Add automated tests for HTTPS enforcement and WebRTC API availability
  - Create test scenarios for different NAT/firewall configurations
  - Implement connection stability tests for extended chat sessions
  - Add automated modern browser compatibility testing (Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+ only)
  - Commit your changes
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement deployment monitoring and maintenance tools
  - Add deployment status checking functionality to verify GitHub Pages availability
  - Create automated health checks for external dependencies (PeerJS, STUN servers)
  - Implement error reporting and logging for deployment-specific issues
  - Add version tracking and deployment history logging
  - Create maintenance mode handling for planned outages or updates
  - Implement rollback procedures and testing for deployment issues
  - Add monitoring for concurrent user limits and performance degradation
  - Commit your changes
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 5.2_
